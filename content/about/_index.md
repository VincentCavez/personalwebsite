I am a PhD student at [Inria][1] Saclay, France, and I have the chance to work under the supervision of [Emmanuel Pietriga][7] and [Caroline Appert][8] within the [ILDA team][2].

My thesis subject is ["Post-WIMP Interactive Data Manipulation"][6] but I prefer to call it by its core concept: "Structure versus freedom". On the one hand, computers are known for their structured software that you can master using mouse and keyboard, and on the other hand, tablets offer a greater freedom of action thanks to the pen and touch inputs. If not designed carefully, tablets software fail to benefit from this structure and from their own flexibility potential. Recently, I focused on people who use spreadsheets, music scores and maps and proposed interactive techniques to improve their tablet use.
