I am currently a third-year PhD student at [Paris-Saclay University][1], and I am fortunate to work with [Emmanuel Pietriga][7] and [Caroline Appert][8] in the [ILDA team][2].

My thesis subject is ["Post-WIMP Interactive Data Manipulation"][6] but I often call it by its core concept: "Structure versus freedom". On the one hand, computers are known for their structured software that you can master using mouse and keyboard, and on the other hand, tablets offer a greater freedom of action thanks to the pen and touch inputs. If not designed carefully, tablets software fail to benefit from both structure and their own flexibility potential. Thus, I work on interactive techniques to bind together these two aspects and improve the workflow on spreadsheets, music scores and maps.
