Hi! I'm Vincent Cavez, PhD in Human-Computer Interaction. I was fortunate to work on my PhD thesis under the supervision of [Emmanuel Pietriga][7] and [Caroline Appert][8], within the [ILDA team][2].

My thesis subject was _"Designing Pen-based Interactions for Productivity and Creativity"_ but I often call it by its core concept: "Structure versus Freedom". On the one hand, computers are known for their structured software that you can master using mouse and keyboard, and on the other hand, tablets offer a greater freedom of action thanks to the pen and touch inputs. If not designed carefully, tablets software fail to benefit from both structure and their own flexibility potential. Thus, I worked on interactions to bind together these two aspects and promote productivity and creativity.
