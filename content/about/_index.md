Hi! I'm Vincent Cavez, a french Postdoctoral Scholar in [Human-Centered AI][10] and [Education][11] at Stanford University. Under the supervision of [Hari Subramonyam][9], I design AI and pen-based interfaces to support speech-language pathologists in tracking progress and optimizing interventions with their patients.

Before that, I was fortunate to pursue my PhD thesis [_"Designing Pen-based Interactions for Productivity and Creativity"_][6] with the help of my amazing supervisors, [Emmanuel Pietriga][7] and [Caroline Appert][8], within the [ILDA team][2].
